## Common Patterns

### Service Checklist

Every service deployment **SHOULD** address:

- [ ] **Authentication**: How is access controlled?
- [ ] **Encryption**: Is traffic encrypted in transit?
- [ ] **Logging**: Are security events logged?
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Are health checks configured?
- [ ] **Backup**: Is configuration backed up?
- [ ] **Updates**: How are security updates applied?

### Configuration Management

- **MUST** use Ansible, Puppet, or similar for production config
- **MUST** version control all configuration
- **SHOULD** test changes in staging before production
- **SHOULD** use templates with environment-specific values

### Documentation

Each service **SHOULD** have:
- Purpose and scope
- Upstream documentation link
- Configuration file locations
- Relevant log files
- Troubleshooting commands
